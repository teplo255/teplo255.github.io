<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I have a website. This is fun.<br>
    I don't really have anything planned to put on here I just wanted to have a website for the fun of it</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>As of the time I'm writiing this (January of 2025), I'm a linguistics junior at FSU. Originally I had planned to get my masters here immediately after I graduate, but they don't have a regular lingusitics masters program so I'm going to wait a while and maybe get my masters in a few years somewhere else. Unfortunately this measn I'll be graduating and leaving university ebfore I turn 21, but I'm going to try to get an IT job here when I graduate so I can continue to benefit from the amenities on campus like the free gym, and keep sneaking into Lucas' classes.<br>
Who is Lucas? Well the Techno Wizard of Tallahassee of couse. He has a lengthy digital footprint so I'm sure you can find out something about him online.</p>
<p>My main hobbies include video games, baking, and reading if I have enouhg of an attention span to do so.</p>
