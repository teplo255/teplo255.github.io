<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I have a website. This is fun.<br>
    I don't really have anything planned to put on here I just wanted to have a website for the fun of it, and as a way to learn some HTML. It's no fun learning it if you don't have anything to use it for.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>As of the time I'm writing this (January 2025), I'm a linguistics junior at FSU. Originally I had planned to get my masters here immediately after I graduate, but they don't have a regular linguistics masters program so I'm going to wait a while and maybe get my masters in a few years somewhere else. Unfortunately, this means I'll be graduating and leaving university before I turn 21, but I'm going to try to get an IT job here when I graduate so I can continue to benefit from the amenities on campus like the free gym, and keep sneaking into Lucas' classes. Who is Lucas? Well the Techno Wizard of Tallahassee of couse. He has a lengthy digital footprint so I'm sure you can find out something about him online.</p>
<p>My main hobbies include video games, baking, and reading if I have enough of an attention span to do so. I'm incredibly autistic about the game Portal, and one piece is my favourite manga. I've been obsessed with learning languaegs since middle school, and origionally was a Russian major, but switched to lingusitics because I like science.</p>
<p>It snowed here in Florida so I got to see snow for the first time</p>
